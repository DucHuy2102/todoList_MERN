# To do List
I am using this project to practice my backend coding skills because my goal is to become a full-stack developer. This project currently only has CRUD functionalities, but I plan to develop it further in the future.


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to download file zip or `git clone https://github.com/DucHuy2102/todoList_MERN.git`

After that, you open 2 terminal:

+ Terminal 1: `cd frontend` --> `npm i`
+ Terminal 2: `cd backend` --> `npm start` 

That's all for now, hope you enjoy it!
